#Session 1: Multimodal 

Aimed mainly at "outside-the-box" thinkers, tinkerers, doodlers, and those individuals who need to synthesize a large amount of information into a succinct form, this first workshop of the New Westminster Innovation Series will explore how essential skills collides with comics and infographics to allow for a"multimodal" forms of communication. Multimodal communication is the discussion of how information is conveyed through different media forms--comics, print, internet, pictures, infographics, television, film, etc. Hoping to attract emerging creative thinkers and entrepreneurs, this workshop will provide plenty of time for networking and open discussion while leading participants through some hands on multimodal experiences.  

The Innovation series is held at the Douglas College Maker Lab at the River Market every second Tuesday from 6:30 to 9pm. The series will provide a space for the discussion of innovative ideas and networking. Featuring a participatory session on an emerging area of interest and an opportunity to discuss the application and relevance of those ideas with members of the community. The series hopes to ignite collaborations between entrepreneurs, technologists, makers, learners, teachers, and hobbyists that will yield new connections and encourage new ways of thinking, making, and doing.

The first three sessions will be led by members of the Douglas College Digital Cultures Lab, a collective of academics whose interests extend beyond the boundaries of traditional approaches to teaching and learning.


#Session 2: 3D Printing and Scanning - Possibilities and Limitations
#May 26, 2015 - 6:30 - 9pm

The second in our series about innovative ideas, technologies, and approaches tackles the emerging world of 3D printing. Directed mostly at novices, those with no experience working with 3D printers, or those who want to think about how 3D printers might shape the future, this workshop will take participants through the main conversations about 3D printing. While we won't have time to print individual projects, participants are encouraged to bring there ideas, questions, or prototypes and discuss their potential. In the end, the workshop will offer abroad overview of 3D printing and leaving participants will be well-equipped with information and context within which they might better understand how 3D printing might apply to them. As usual, there will be lots of time for networking and discussion.

#Session 3: Working with Academics - 7 Types of Awesome Innovative Partnerships
#June 16, 2015 - 6:30 - 9pm

Our third Innovation Series session tackles the pitfalls, issues, and insane wickedness of working with the academic community on entrepreneurial or research-driven projects. In this workshop, we'll lay bare the complicated internal structures of academic life and hopefully provide insight into those structures to that community groups, entrepreneurs, or businesses can be better equipped to work in academic contexts. We will cover granting agencies and structures; academic timelines, expectations, and realities; the sometimes opaque institutional processes that govern academic work; and whatever else might arise. As always, we're relying on a lot of open discussion to guide the workshop so specific issues, questions, or opportunities are welcome. There will also, as usual, be plenty of time for networking and open discussion.
