The New Westminster Innovation Series

The Innovation series is held at the Douglas College Maker Lab at the RiverMarket every second Tuesday from 6:30 to 9pm beginning May 12, 2015. The series will provide a space for the discussion of innovative ideas and networking. Featuring a participatory session on an emerging area of interest and an opportunity to discuss the application and relevance of those ideas with members of the community. The series hopes to ignite collaborations between entrepreneurs, technologists, makers, learners, teachers, and hobbyists that will yield new connections and encourage new ways of thinking, making, and doing. 

The first three sessions will be lead by members of the Douglas College Digital Cultures Lab, a collective of academics whose interests extend beyond the boundaries of traditional approaches to teaching and learning.
