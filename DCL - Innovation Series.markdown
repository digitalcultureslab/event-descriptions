**Building Better Boxes in a Culture of Innovation**

Ever wonder about 3D printing, Rasperry Pi, Arduino, fast prototyping, desktop fabrication, wearables, and everything else new and exciting in the world today? The inaugural Innovation Series workshop at the New Westminster Anvil Centre will provide a hands on experience with some of these concepts and machines while connecting members of the New Westminster community with each other and the innovators in the wings. 

The workshop will feature discussions about 3D printing, fabricating circuitry, prototyping processes, and innovation strategies. Led by the Douglas College Digital Cultures Lab, the session will encourage participants to think differently about the mythologies of technology while at the same time facilitating hands-on opportunities with emerging technological objects and tools.  

**All: Marshmellow Challenge (10-20 minutes)**

	- Group 2: Prototyping (Design)
	- Group 3: Circuitry (Stickers - Design part II - Scalability)
	- Group 4: Representations (Advertising - what's it look like?)

- Supervisors: 

	- Group 5: Connected Infrastructures (Globalization? What are the constraints for others)
	- Group 6: Outcomes (what's the task / what would this do?)
	- Group 7: Where's the Bullshit? (Who's fudging? What's real and meaningful)
